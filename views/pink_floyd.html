    <h1>Comfortably Numb</h1>
    <h4>Pink Floyd</h4>
    <h2>
 Hello? (Hello? Hello? Hello?)
<br>
I'll need some information first <br>
Just the basic facts<br>
Can you show me where it hurts?<br>
There is no pain you are receding<br>
A distant ship smoke on the horizon<br>
You are only coming through in waves<br>
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying<br>
When I was a child I had a fever<br>
My hands felt just like two balloons<br>
Now I've got that feeling once again<br>
I can't explain you would not understand<br>
This is not how I am<br>
I have become comfortably numb<br>
I have become comfortably numb<br>
Okay (okay, okay, okay)<br>
Just a little pinprick<br>
There'll be no more, ah<br>
But you may feel a little sick<br>
Can you stand up?<br>
I do believe it's working, good<br>
That'll keep you going through the show<br>
Come on it's time to go<br>
There is no pain you are receding<br>
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon<br>
You are only coming through in waves<br>
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying<br>
When I was a child<br>
I caught a fleeting glimpse<br>
Out of the corner of my eye<br>
I turned to look but it was gone<br>
I cannot put my finger on it now<br>
The child is grown<br>
The dream is gone<br>
I have become comfortably numb"
